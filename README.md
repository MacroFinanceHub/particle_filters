## Particle Filters

### PS4 - problem 3
 
Bootstrap particle filter and conditionally-optimal particle filter for small-scale DSGE model in *Herbst and Schorfheide (2015)*.

Two experiments:

- **Robustness of empirical results:** change the sample to 1999:IV - 2019:III

- **Performance of the algorithm:** run the filter multiple times and compute summary statistics for the accuracy of the likelihood approximation.
